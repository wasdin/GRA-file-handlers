This is a set of file handlers that can be used with graph files, as defined in [Clinched Highway Mapping Data](http://courses.teresco.org/chm/) by [Dr. James Teresco](http://teresco.org/). 

These files can be viewed using [this viewer](http://courses.teresco.org/chm/viewer/) and example files can be found [here](http://courses.teresco.org/chm/graphs.html).

This code was completed as part of an assignment for a data structures and algorithms course. The project description can be found [here](http://kepler.covenant.edu/COS230/AsgDijkstraImproved/Assignment%20Dijkstra%20using%20Google%20Maps.htm).

This code is put on-line with the hopes that it can make it easier to interact with the file format specified for others who wish to use the graph file format as specified.
